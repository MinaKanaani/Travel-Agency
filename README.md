# Travel-Agency
Travel Agencies offer advice on destinations, plan trip itineraries, and make travel arrangements for clients. Having an inclusive system in which they can manage flights, tickets, passengers and destination suggestion can be a of great use and it can certainly facilitate the process for the client as well as the Travel Agency itself.  That's precisely why I decided to simulate the similar system for flight agencies , using Microsoft Access to help carve the experience of traveling with airplanes as a memorable and convenient means of travel in both passengers and Agencies' minds.
